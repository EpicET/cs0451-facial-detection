# cs0451-facial-detection
By Cameron Hudson, Robsan Dinka, and Emmanuel Towner

## Abstract

A test push to see if this works.

## Motivation and Question

The goal is to create a deep learning model that can accurately detect faces in images and provide a confidence score for each detection. The application can be used in various fields such as security and social media. As companies move away from traditional password systems, biometrics, such as a facial detection, are more common. 

## Planned Deliverables


## Resources Required

Our data is from Kaggle's [Face-Detection-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fareselmenshawii/face-detection-dataset) that our model will be train on. The libraries we will use are PyTorch and Jupyter Notebook. If we need more computational power, we can use ADA's GPU resources to train our model.

## What You Will Learn

Emmanuel will learn how to create and implement a convolution neural betwork (CNN) to use for facial recognition using PyTorch.

## Risk Statement


## Ethics Statement

1. Biggest benefactors are the government and tech companies that are centered around using cameras for biometrics or security.
