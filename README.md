# cs0451-facial-detection
By Cameron Hudson, Robsan Dinka, and Emmanuel Towner

## Abstract

A test push to see if this works.

## Motivation and Question

There are many ways traditional password systems can get stolen and grant hackers unauthorized access to our private information and assets. Therefore, another method of security is necessary, such as biometrics. We have a dataset of images that contain faces and images that do not contain faces. These will be used to implement a neural network that can identify faces in images and webcams which will be useful implementing biometric security.

## Planned Deliverables


## Resources Required

Our data is from Kaggle's [Face-Detection-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fareselmenshawii/face-detection-dataset) that our model will be train on. The libraries we will use are PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, and OpenCV.

## What You Will Learn

1. Emmanuel Towner: Learn how to create a CNN and use a webcam for facial recognition.

## Risk Statement

1. We may not have the computational power to train and test our model efficiently.
2. The process to transform our static image algorithm to utilize webcams may be more involved than intially thought.

## Ethics Statement

1. The biggest benefactors are commercial companies, as they could use the model to provide additional security to their services. Customers are also potential benefactors as their data might be more secure. 

## Tentative Timeline
