By Cameron Hudson, Robsan Dinka, and Emmanuel Towner

## Abstract


## Motivation and Question

We have a dataset that contains facial and non-facial images. These will be used to train a neural network that can identify
faces in images and webcams which will be useful security devices.

## Planned Deliverables


## Resources Required

Our data is from Kaggle's [Face-Detection-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fareselmenshawii/face-detection-dataset) that our model will be train on. The libraries we will use are PyTorch and Jupyter Notebook.

## What You Will Learn


## Risk Statement

1. The process to transform our static image algorithm to utilize webcams may be more involved than intially thought.
2. There is a risk that data has very homogenous facial images therefore making it unsuccessful in identifying diverse groups of people. 

## Ethics Statement

1. The biggest benefactors are commercial companies, as they could use the model to provide additional security to their services. Customers are also potential benefactors as their data might be more secure.
