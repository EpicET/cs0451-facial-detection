## Abstract
The problem we are attempting to solve is concerning the detection
of faces within images. The approach we are doing to solve this problem is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network and train it on a face detection dataset. To assess the model's accuracy, we will be looking for 80-85% accuracy on testing data. 

## Motivation and Question

## Planned Deliverables

Full success: In a full success scenario, we will deliver a real-time image detection algorithm, which can utilize a camera to detect and trace a face within a video stream.

Partial success: In a partial success scenario. Our algorithm will be able to classify images as containing or not containing a face with 80-85% accuracy.
