## Abstract
A test push to see if this works.

## Motivation and Question

## Planned Deliverables

## Resources Required

## What You Will Learn

## Risk Statement

## Ethics Statement
Using our facial detection system, we will be able to detect faces in images and videos. This can be used for various purposes, such as security, surveillance, and even social media applications. Our model will be able to detect faces in real-time, which can be useful for video conferencing and live streaming. However, we must be cautions that our model is not used to violate privacy by collecting data without consent. Overall, our model will be more useful than harmful, as it can be used to improve security and enhance user experience in various applications.

While making this project, we are assuming that people who use our model will do so ethically and responsibly. Another assumption that we are making is that our model will be able to detect faces accurately reguardless of lighting, race, and other factors.
