# cs0451-facial-detection
By Cameron Hudson, Robsan Dinka, and Emmanuel Towner

## Abstract

A test push to see if this works.

## Motivation and Question

The goal is to create a deep learning model that can accurately detect faces in images and provide a confidence score for each detection. The application can be used in various fields such as security and social media. As companies move away from traditional password systems, biometrics, such as a facial detection, are more common. 

## Planned Deliverables


## Resources Required

 

## What You Will Learn

Emmanuel will learn how to create and implement a convolution neural betwork (CNN) to use for facial recognition.
