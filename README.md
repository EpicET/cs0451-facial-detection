## Abstract
The problem we are attempting to solve is automated security systems using facial detection. The approach we are doing to solve this problem is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network and train it on a face detection dataset. To assess the model's accuracy, we will be looking for 80-85% accuracy on testing data. 

## Motivation and Question

## Planned Deliverables

Full success: In a full success scenario, we will deliver a real-time image detection algorithm, which can utilize a camera to detect and trace a face within a video stream.

Partial success: In a partial success scenario. Our algorithm will be able to classify images as containing or not containing a face with 80-85% accuracy.

## Resources Required

## What You Will Learn
We all intend to improve our skills using Git version control, improve our teamworking skills, and learn the implementation of a convolutional neural network and
its application in facial detection.

Robsan Dinka: Specifically intrested in the math that goes into the implementation of a convolutional neural network, and wants to improve their skills with git command line. 
Cameron Hudson: Specifically interested in learning how we will use the algorithm to detect faces in a video stream, how to utilize our laptop's built-in camera and use our algorithm implementation in tandem. 
Emmanuel Towner: Has a high-level understanding of how neural networks work, and is interesting in how convolution neural networks differ from regular neural networks. Also wants to get better at the git command line.
